**Simple WPF Application with SQL Server Database**
<br>
For my submission, I designed an application that utilizes WPF and ADO.Net, connected to a local Microsoft SQL database server.
In this WPF Application, I created a marketplace where users can add products and view all of the products that were added.
A Product object consists of a name, quantity, price and description.

Upon pressing the 'Add Item' button, the product is displayed in the 'View Products' tab, and all input fields are cleared.

**Please refer to the CreateProduct.sql file to view the Product table**
